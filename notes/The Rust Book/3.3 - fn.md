snake case convention
```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

Rust doesn't care where functions are declared before/after main, they just must be within the scope (like js's `let` or `function`) 

functions are made up of a series of statements ending in an expression
Rust is an expression-based language
- Statements -> instructions that perform some action and do not return a value
	- let y = 6;
- Expressions -> evaluate to a resultant value
	- `let y = { let x = 3; x + 1 };`

statements always end with a semi-column `;`

###### return values
declare types of return values with `...() -> type`
return early with `return` but most functions return the last expression imlicitly
```
fn five() -> i32 { 
	5 
} 

fn main() { 
	let x = five(); 
	println!("The value of x is: {x}"); 
}
```
