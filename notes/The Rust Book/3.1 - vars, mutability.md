by default, rust variables are immutable, one you assign a val to a var it then can not change, unless you explicitly `mut` it

you can also have constant values with `const` that don't allow `mut` 
if you use `const` you must annotate the type of the value
constants can be declared at any scope, including global
naming convention should be `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`

###### shadowing
```
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1;
    {
        let x = x * 2;
    }
}
```
- we init a `let` variable `x`
- we shadow the `x` global variable to `6`
- we shadow the `x` local scope variable to `12`
	- this shadowing will only take place on the respective scope `{...}` and will not affect the global scope variable

we're effectively creating a new `x` variable every time we `shadow` 
shadowing can be used to effectively change types of a variable

when shadowing you can change the types of the variable
```
let spaces = " "; 
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

when mutating, that isn't allowed
```
let mut spaces = "   ";
spaces = spaces.len();
```
