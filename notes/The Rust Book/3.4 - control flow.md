```
fn main() {
    let number = 3;
    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
	}
}
```

conditions can also accept booleans (must be of type `bool`)
unlike JS, rust will not automatically try to convert non-bool's to a bool
you must be explicit

we can use if in a let statement, since `if` is an expression
```
fn main() {
	let condition = true
	let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
}
```
so, number will be assigned of value 5
the types of all arms must be the same (in this case `i32`)

you can assign the returned value from a loop to a variable. the returned value is always what is breaking the loop
```
fn main(){
	let number = 0
	
	let result = loop {
		number += 1
		if number == 10 {
			break number * 2;
		}
	}
}
```

break and continue references only the innermost loop, if we want to target parent loops then we can do so by tagging them `'tag: loop {...` 
```
'parent_loop: loop {
	...
	loop {
		...
		break 'parent_loop;
		...
		break;
	}
}
```

when looping requires conditionals, you can still use if/else but why the fuck not use while loop
```
while condition {
	...do this shit...
}
```

and when looping over a collection, although you can while loop:
```
let collection: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3]; 
let mut index = 0;
while index < collection.len() {
	printlnt!("value: {}", a[index]);
	index += 1;
}
```

you should just use a for loop honestly, much safer
```
for element in collection {
	println!("{}", element)
}
```

actually, now that I'm thinking about it, just use a for loop for everything
even for count downs, use can use a range and rev -
```
for iteration in (1..4).rev() {
	... iteration ...
}
```
