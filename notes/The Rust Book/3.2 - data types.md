every value is of a certain data type
- Scalar
- Compound

Rust is `statically typed` language
- it must know the types of all variables at compile time
- compiler usually infers the type based on the value and how we use it

in cases where a variable can have multiple types (shadowing a variable) then we must add a type annotation
```
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

#### Scalar Types
a single value
- integer
- float
- boolean
- character

###### Integers
unsigned integer (signed integers start with `i` instead of `u`) and takes 32 bits of space
```
|Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
------------------------------
| 8-bit  | i8     | u8       |
| 16-bit | i16    | u16      |
| 32-bit | i32    | u32      |
| 64-bit | i64    | u64      |
| 128-bit| i128   | u128     |
| arch   | isize  | usize    |
```

signed & unsigned means if it can ever be negative, if it needs a `sign` or not (+/-)

**integer overflow** happens when you increase a variable's value more than it can have (u8 given a value of 256), this panics the program at runtime

###### Floats
two primitive types for floating numbers
- `f32`
- `f64`
default is 64 bits because on modern CPU it's the same speed as 32 bit but is capable of more precision. **all floating types are signed** 

###### Boolean
- true
- false
one byte size, `bool`

###### Character
four bytes in size, unicode scalar value -> can represent more than just ASCII
one character, emoji, etc...

#### Compound Types
multiple values into one type
- Tuples
- Arrays

###### Tuple
a grouping together of a number of values, with fixed length. once declared can not change length.
types don't have to be the same
```
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
```
index positioned. we create a tuple, and assign it to `tup` var

to destruct
```
let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup;
println!("The value of y is: {y}");
```
you can also use the `.` pattern to destruct, followed by the index of the tuple element
```
let six_point_four = tup.1;
```

###### Array
every element must have the same type
Arrays have a fixed length too
```
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
allocates the data on the stack rather than the heap
isn't as flexible as vector type, which can grow and shrink in size. use vector.

type of the array
```
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let variable: [type; length] = [...]
```

to access arrays, use index
```
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = a[0];
```
