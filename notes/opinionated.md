multi paradigm -> both OO & func

>For me, the central value proposition of functional programming is that it tries as hard as possible to eliminate shared mutable state. Most functional languages accomplish this by eliminating the "mutable" part, but Rust achieves it by eliminating the "shared" part. The end result is the same: a language in which you can reason confidently and precisely about how information flows through your program.
